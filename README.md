# Quick start
It is recommended to install docsify-cli globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

# Initialize

If you want to write the documentation in the ./docs subdirectory, you can use the init command.

```bash
docsify init ./docs
```

# Preview your site
Run the local server with docsify serve. You can preview your site in your browser on http://localhost:3000.

```bash
docsify serve docs
```
