## Bosch Building Technologies Ontology Central

https://www.boschbuildingsolutions.com/xc/en/news-and-stories/building-ontologies/

https://github.com/boschglobal/building-technologies-ontology-central

I am the author of the Bosch Building Technologies Ontology Central which contains ontology models relevant for commercial buildings. Currently Foundation Ontology, Fire Alarm Systems Ontology and HVAC Systems Ontology have been open sourced. Ontologies related to other BT domains are being worked on and will be open sourced soon.

### Foundation Ontology

https://github.com/boschglobal/building-technologies-ontology-central/tree/main/com/bosch/bt/Foundation/2.0.0

The **foundation ontology** is the digital common foundation layer (a shared domain kernel) of [Bosch Building Technologies](https://www.boschbuildingtechnologies.com/xc/en/) domain ontology models. All the common aspects for a building digital twin are defined by this **foundation ontology**. This **foundation ontology** allows cross domain (service) considerations and enables a dynamic extension point for a `Digital Twin` by using roles.

The diagram below shows the `Core` of the **foundation ontology** the set of core models with their relationships.

![Foundation.Package](./_images/projects/bosch/Foundation.Package.drawio.png)

### Fire Alarm System Ontology

https://github.com/boschglobal/building-technologies-ontology-central/blob/main/com/bosch/bt/fire-alarm-systems/2.0.0

The Fire Alarm Systems Ontology is based on the Bosch Foundation Ontology and uses the foundation concepts of `Zone`, `Asset`, `DataPoint` and `Collection`.

The diagram below shows the core elements of the fire ontology, the foundation concepts like points are not shown.

![Fire.Core](./_images/projects/bosch/Fire.Core.drawio.png)

### HVAC System Ontology

https://github.com/boschglobal/building-technologies-ontology-central/blob/main/com/bosch/bt/hvac-systems/2.0.0

HVAC system ontology to describe  HVAC entities like  `Dampers`, `Pumps`, `Thermal Distributors` (e.g. `AHU`), `Thermal Exchanger`, and `Thermal Sources` (e.g. `Chillers`).

The diagram below shows the core elements of the HVAC system, the foundation concepts like points are not shown.
