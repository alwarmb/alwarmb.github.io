# TECHNOLOGY EXPERTISE

## Solution Architecture

Solution architecture is a practice to provide ground for software development projects by tailoring IT solutions to specific business needs and defining their functional requirements and stages of implementation. Solution architecture is the means to execute or realise a technology strategy.

In this section you will find solution architecture diagrams and technology descriptions for reference architectures, real world examples of cloud architectures, and solution ideas for common workloads.

## Software Architecture

The software architecture of a system serves as a blueprint for a system and depicts the system’s organization or structure and provides an explanation of how it behaves. A system represents the collection of components that accomplish a specific function or set of functions. Hence, software architecture provides an abstraction to manage the system complexity and establish a communication and coordination mechanism among components.

Software design is the process of conceptualizing the software requirements into software implementation. This is the initial phase within the software development life cycle (SDLC) — shifting the concentration from the problem to the solution.
