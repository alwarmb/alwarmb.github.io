## Event Driven Architecture

An event-driven architecture consists of event producers that generate a stream of events, and event consumers that listen for the events.

## Serverless event processing

This reference architecture shows a serverless, event-driven architecture that ingests a stream of data, processes the data, and writes the results to a back-end database.
