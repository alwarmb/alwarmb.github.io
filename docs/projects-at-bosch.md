BVMS is a modular and resilient security system that aggregates and delivers consolidated data to security operators in a way that helps them make informed decisions – so they can trigger the right actions and deploy a swift response to improve security and safety. In addition, it ensures that data is available and secured at all times. Thanks to its scalability, BVMS grows with the user’s needs. From BVMS Viewer to Lite, Plus, Professional or Enterprise, it can easily be upgraded while keeping the same look and feel so that no further operator training is required.

BVMS Operator Client is an important component of the BVMS software which offers
- Live monitoring
- Storage retrieval and playback
- Forensic Search (post motion search)
- Alarm and accessing multiple Management Server computers simultaneously

The Bosch Building Integration System (BIS) is a software solution that manages different Bosch security subsystems like access control, video surveillance, fire alarm, public address or intrusion systems on one single platform.

Besides, Bosch BIS offers a “tool box” to allow integration with third party applications via open standards and Software Development Kits (SDK).
