## Project Details

The Remote Services project involves the modernisation of our existing remote services infrastructure EffiLink. The new technical basis is the Microsoft Azure platform (Cloud).

- **Remote Services**: Network customer's building infrastructe with the cloud-based Remote Services platform via a secure connections. This allows us to analyze and configure your security systems and troubleshoot problems remotely.
- **Condition Monitoring**: Support maintenance remotely, detect faults early and before they occur and initiate measures automatically.
- **Inspection**: Safe, digital documentation maintenance which are audit-proof and of high-quality - enabling  automatically recorded in inspection plans.

#### Advantages of using Remote Services - Next Gen

- **Compatible with all Bosch security systems:** You can use the remote services and benefits for all of your Bosch security technology.
- **Smooth installation:** Remote Services enable your security systems to be installed quickly and effectively. Our on-site specialists and technicians work hand in hand.
- **Reliable data protection:** The processing of data meets the highest data protection standards.
- **Permanent backup:** Once access to the platform has been set up, the current configuration is continuously backed up and can always be used in the event of faults and failures.
- **Continuous updates:** We always keep our platform up to date. We take care of software updates for new program versions for you.
- **Effective remote access:** Our remote service experts quickly and reliably assess the status of your security systems on screen and actively intervene if necessary - but without disrupting regular on-site operations.
- **Fix faults faster:** If a fault cannot be fixed remotely, a detailed remote diagnosis is carried out in order to optimally prepare the technician for the on-site work. The benefit for you: shorter downtimes and thus increased availability of your systems.
