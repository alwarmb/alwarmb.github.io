# C•CURE 9000

Software House C•CURE® 9000 brings the best of physical and logical security together by integrating core access control functionality with a wide variety of business applications. 

Using standard IT tools and processes including Microsoft® .NET v3.5, web services, XML, SQL Server 2005, and Oracle 10g, C•CURE 9000 makes it easy for an IT professional to add it to the company’s network infrastructure. 

C•CURE 9000 delivers powerful security and event management functionality via an intuitive user interface that is similar to Microsoft’s Outlook® and Explorer with its easy navigation and tree structures. A practical application layout editor lets users drag and drop any application onto one screen and creates a customized hub for all activities via a single “command and control” center. 

No matter how distributed a business may be, C•CURE 9000 will help incorporate security throughout its enterprise, managing physical access control and other critical events from a virtual hub of integrated applications.
